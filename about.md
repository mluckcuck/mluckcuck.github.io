I have recently completed a PhD in Computer Science at the [University of York](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/), titled _Safety-Critical Java Level 2: Applications, Modelling, and Verification_. More details of my thesis and my publications during my PhD work can be found on the [Publications](/publications/) page. I've studied Computer Science, in some form, since my A-Levels; so I've got a wide experience of Comptuer Science topics at a range of education levels.
