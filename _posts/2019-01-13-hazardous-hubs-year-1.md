In a previous post I described [my job](/myJob) as a Research Associate; January is the anniversary of starting work on this project full-time, so this article gives a run-down of what I've been up to for the past year.

Some of the work has been academic publications, for the [RAIN](http://rainhub.org.uk/), [ORCA](https://orcahub.org/), and [FAIR-SPACE](https://www.fairspacehub.org/) hubs. I've also managed to arrange some workshops and tutorial for 2019. Previously I've talked about lots of fun outreach activities I've been involved in, and there are other work activities to mention too.

## Papers

In 2018 I managed to write up three papers, one of which was accepted, one is in review, and one was rejected (and is being hastily re-written!)

When I started on this job I hadn't worked on robotics or autonomous systems before; my [PhD work](/research/#thesis) focussed on [formal methods](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/fm-what.html) (mathematically-based techniques for the specification and modelling of software). My new colleague Marie and I (ok, ok, mostly Marie) thought it would be a good idea to write up the survey of robotics literature that we had started.

[Our survey]() formed around a few key questions we had about the application of formal methods used in autonomous or robotic systems. It became a pretty large paper, but it really helped; it gave us a nice grounding in what had already been done in the area. We submitted the paper to a journal, which rejected it initially for plagerism. When we looked at the result, the majority of the passages that we'd 'plagerised' were things like: one of our co-authors name's, the journal's own copyright notice, and various acronyms. Once I'd fixed these problems, we resubmitted it and it's still under review -- so we have our fingers crossed.

Next we (again, Marie and me) write a position paper, which drew on the work that went into the survey paper. During the survey, we found that many approaches using formal methods targetted one particular part of the robotic system. It seemed that this was because of the complexity of robotic systems and the range of different components that comprise them. From this, our position was that the formal methods community must work towards applying __integrated__ formal methods (combinations of several formal methods into one, which merges the benefits of each method) to robotic systems. This was accepted, and presented (by Marie) at the conference on [Integrated Formal Methods 2018]() where it won the Best Presentation award!

The final paper describes a framework for integrating different types of verification, both formal and non-formal. This is useful becuase each componnetn of arobotic system might be verified in a different way (testing, model checking, simulation-based testing, theorum prooving, etc). We don't want to prevent this, since each verification method is (hopefully) picked because it is the best method to tackle that particular compontn. So, we introduce a shared first-oirder logic specification that describes the system and acts like a logical prototype. This specification is used to guide the properties/tests, etc that are used by the verification methods. Unfortunately, this paper was rejected; we're reworking it now for submission to another venue. It did, however, form the basis of a recent [poster]() that I presented at an internal meeting for the [RAIN]() project.
