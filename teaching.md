University Demonstrating
------------------------

* In 2015---2016: assisting in the workshop sessions for two terms of a first year undergraduate module, introducing programming concepts, in the Computer Science degree at the University of York.

..* In the first term, the module focused on basic programming using Python. My contact time for the term was 20 hours.
..* In the second term, the module focused on objects and inheritance, and used both Python and Java. My contact time was 28 hours.
..* Each group contained around 65 students of very mixed ability.

* In 2015: assisting in the workshop sessions for a LaTeX module for PhD student at the University of York. The group contained around 12 PhD students and my contact time was 5 hours.
* I also assisted in a workshop session on LaTeX for an MSc module, also with around 12 students.

Code Club
---------

I volunteer with a local Code Club, helping children to learn basic programming and computational thinking using Scratch.

Tutoring
--------
 * Tutoring an A-Level Computing student, one-on-one. We focussed on covering key topics, and improved the student's exam grade by two grade boundaries. My contact time was 20 hours (1 hour per week).

 Other Activities
 ----------------

 During 2014 I was the Programme Committee chair for the York Doctoral Symposium on Computer Science and Electronics (YDS2014), a student conference organised at the University of York. I was responsible for recruiting programme-committee members and ensuring that submissions were reviewed fairly. I also co-lead an interdepartmental team of PhD students in the planning and organisation of YDS2014.
