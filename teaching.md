University Demonstrating
------------------------

During my PhD I took the opportunity to demonstrate on several modules of different levels and class sizes.

* Two terms demonstrating in the workshop sessions of a first year undergraduate module, introducing programming concepts, in the Computer Science degree at the University of York.
  - In the first term, the module focused on basic programming using Python. My total contact time was 20 hours.
  - In the second term, the module focused on objects and inheritance, and used both Python and Java. My total contact time was 28 hours.
  - Each group contained around 65 students of very mixed ability.
* One term demonstrating in the workshop sessions for a LaTeX module for PhD students at the University of York. The group contained around 12 PhD students and my contact time was 5 hours.
* I also assisted in a workshop session on LaTeX for an MSc module. There were approximately 12 masters-level students.


Code Club
---------

I volunteer with a local [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk), helping children to learn basic programming and computational thinking, using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about). I find Scratch a useful language for teaching children programming, because it only allows blocks of code to fit together in a grammatically correct way. This focusses debugging on the _logic_ of the program rather than the syntax of the language.


Tutoring
--------

I have tutored an A-Level Computing student, one-on-one, to improve their exam and coursework grades. We focussed on covering key topics from the syllabus that the student felt they hadn't grasped well enough. Together, we improved their final grade by two grade boundaries. My total contact time was around 20 hours (1 hour per week).

Other Activities
----------------

During 2014 I was the Programme Committee chair for the York Doctoral Symposium on Computer Science and Electronics (YDS2014), a student conference organised at the University of York. I was responsible for recruiting programme-committee members and ensuring that submissions were reviewed fairly. I also co-lead an interdepartmental team of PhD students in the planning and organisation of YDS2014.
