I'm a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science). I work on developing and applying formal verification techniques to automated and autonomous systems.

Previously I've been a Research Associate at the Universities of [Manchester](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/matthew.luckcuck.html) and [Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/). I got my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of York](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/). More details of my thesis, publications, and current project can be found on the [Research](/research/) page.

I've also found teaching very enjoyable and rewarding. I've been DBS checked and my teaching experience has ranged over many age- and ability-levels; from 8 to (nearly) 80, and from beginners to university level. Details of my teaching experience can be found on the [Teaching and Outreach](/teaching/) page.

A current(ish) version of my CV can be found [here](/files/MSL-CV.pdf).
