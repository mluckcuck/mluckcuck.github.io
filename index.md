I'm a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Derby, in the UK. I work on developing and applying formal verification techniques to automated and autonomous systems. In 2019 I co-founded the [Workshop on Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems](https://fmasworkshop.github.io/).

Previously I've worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science), on the EU-funded [Verification and Validation of Automated Systemsâ€™ Safety and Security](https://valu3s.eu/) project; and as a Research Associate at the Universities of [Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/autonomy-and-verification/) and [Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of York](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/). More details of my thesis and research can be found on the [Research](/research/) page.

I've also found teaching very enjoyable and rewarding. I've been DBS checked and my teaching experience has ranged over many age- and ability-levels; from 8 to (nearly) 80, and from beginners up to university level. Details of my teaching experience can be found on the [Teaching and Outreach](/teaching/) page.

A current(ish) version of my CV can be found [here](/files/MSL-CV.pdf).
