<img alt="A picture of Matt Luckcuk taken in 2023. He is a white man with an oval face, long brown hair that comes over his shoulders, and a medium-length brown beard.

I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Nottingham, UK. I work on developing and applying formal verification techniques to automated and autonomous systems. I am part of the [Autonomy and Verification Network](https://autonomy-and-verification.github.io/), which is a research collaboration focussing on verification of autonomous systems.  In 2019 I co-founded the [Workshop on Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems](https://fmasworkshop.github.io/).

Previously I've worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/computer-science), on the EU-funded [Verification and Validation of Automated Systems’ Safety and Security](https://valu3s.eu/) project; and as a Research Associate at the Universities of [Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/autonomy-and-verification/) and [Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/) on the [RAIN Hub](https://rainhub.org.uk/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of York](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/). More details of my thesis and research can be found on the [Research](/research/) page.
