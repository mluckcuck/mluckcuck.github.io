I'm a Research Assistant in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/) at the University of Liverpool. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of York](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/). More details of my thesis, publications, and current project can be found on the [Research](/research/) page.

I've also found teaching very enjoyable and rewarding. I've been DBS checked and my teaching experience has ranged over many age- and ability-levels; from 8 to (nearly) 80, and from beginners to university level. Details of my teaching experience can be found on the [Teaching and Outreach](/teaching/) page.

A current version of my CV can be found [here](/files/MSL-CV.pdf).
