Computer Coding for Beginners
------------------------

This course introduces the basics of computer programming and computational thinking (the approaches to solving problems using a computer). No prior experience of computer programming is assumed.

Each week we will introduce new programming concepts, building towards a more complex project in the final weeks. The course will cover:
* Variables and Collections,
* Branching,
* Looping,
* Basic User Input,
* Functions.

#### Exercise Solutions

This is how I've solved the problems set in the exercises, but they may not be the _only_ solution. Your program doesn't have to look like mine to be right.
