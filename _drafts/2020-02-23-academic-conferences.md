A little run down of what a conference is like and how to navigate, with extra considerations for those talking and those with depression/anxiety

This is a short description of what an academic conference is like, for anyone new to them. I'll also talk about my experience going to them and dealing with the anxiety I often feel while there.

## What is a Conference?

Academic conferences are one of the main ways that a researcher communicates their work. Basically, a bunch of researchers get together and present their work to each other. This is often in a conference centre, hotel, university, or similar.

Conferences might only last a day or may last a week or more.  I'm using the word conference in this post, but the name might vary; the event might be a conference, workshop, symposium, etc. ([This](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1704) PhD Comics panel shows a satirical take on naming your academic event, and while I might not agree with the flowchart I've definitely seen all of those names used!) Also, sometimes you might see a 'federated' conference, where a few events have joined together but retain separate topics, rules, submission tracks, etc. This might be a permant federation, or a less regular co-location (like the [longest event I've seen](https://www.floc2018.org), which was 19 days but only happens every four years).
