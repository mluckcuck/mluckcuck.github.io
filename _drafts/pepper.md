On the 16th of October this year, a Pepper robot, owned by Middlesex University, was [presented as a demonstration](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/news-parliament-2017/fourth-industrial-revolution-pepper-robot-evidence-17-19/) to the Commons Select Committee on Education. The robot was brought in by representatives from the university of Middlesex for the committee's discussion on the implications for education of the future of artificial intelligence. As an example of current robotics research, this is a good idea; politicians certainly need more connection with current technology. 

However, the language used to describe this demonstration is troubling.

The Education Committee's [page](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/news-parliament-2017/fourth-industrial-revolution-pepper-robot-evidence-17-19/) says that Pepper is a "witness" that will be answering questions. This was picked up several UK news outlets such as 
the [London Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/a-robot-is-set-to-appear-in-parliament-for-the-first-time-a3959946.html) and the [Metro](https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/16/a-robot-just-appeared-as-a-the-first-non-human-witness-in-parliament-8043034), which both mention that the robot is a witness. 

Since the committee's website uses the word "witness", this seems like acceptable reporting. 

However, many news outlets went a step further, claiming that the robot would be giving "evidence" to the committee; for example, the [London Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/a-robot-is-set-to-appear-in-parliament-for-the-first-time-a3959946.html), [ITV](http://www.itv.com/news/2018-10-16/pepper-the-robot-gives-evidence-in-parliament/), and [the Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7505974/pepper-robot-commons-committee-mps-parliament/). Thankfully, a few refrained from imbuing the robot with too much agency, including the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45879961) and the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2018/oct/16/pepper-the-robot-answers-mps-questions-videos). (Though the robot is quoted as thanking the committee for inviting it to give "evidence".)

Why is this subtle difference in use of language such a bad thing?

Simply put, the explanation is too simple.

The committee's questions were submitted to the team from the University of Middlesex prior to the session, and the answers were prepared. In effect, the evidence was being given __by__ the team from the university but __via__ the robot. Casting this as a robot, as an AI, giving evidence may have just been tongue in cheek; but if a person had been given the same questions, written their answers, and called the committee session by phone, then it would still be the person giving the evidence and not the phone.

//some AI and Autonomous systems explanation is needed in here

True, the robot is using techniques from AI to detect words in the questions and select the (pre-written) reply. However, this is not an autonomous choice of reply, so saying that the robot is giving "evidence" is very misleading.

Ultimately, this was an adequate demonstration of the robot, but not a very good demonstration of AI or autonomous systems.


//Given AI/AS descrption, point at the potential societal impacts
