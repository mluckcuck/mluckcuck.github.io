I'm convening a dissertation module at work, so I'm thinking a lot about academic writing. I don't remeber being taught most of what I think I know about academic writing, I think a lot of it was picked up during my PhD (partly from reading a lot, partly from getting comments back on my writing).
But I now often find myself reusing structures in my own writing and looking for them in other people's writing, useful parts of papers and dissertations that help perform a specific function. I've started to think of these as **recpipies**, so I'm going to write some of them down to see if they're useful.

First Up...
