March has been filled with work-based travel (with a little sightseeing thrown in). I'm not sure if collecting so much travel into one month was such a good idea, but that's what I did. Most of the travel was around the UK, but then a surprise visit to Norway presented itself.

The people and places I went to visit were all worthwhile, but overall march was _exhausting_!

## Trek to Trondheim

First up was the surprise trip to Norway that I mentioned. Michael (my boss) emailed me to ask if I'd like to go to a workshop that he'd been invited to but couldn't attend. The workshop looked interesting and it was in Trondheim, which I'd never been to before, so off I went to the first [International Workshop on Autonomous System Safety](https://www.ntnu.edu/imt/iwass) -- an invite-only workshop for autonomous systems experts.

I say 'off I went', but it wasn't actually that easy. My first flight was delayed, so I spent a **lot** longer in Schiphol airport than I had intended. The saving grace being that I got to try Poffertjes for the first time.

The second flight was also delayed, so I didn't arrive in Trondheim until early the next morning. The 22 hour day caused a but of a dint in my concentration for the first day of the workshop!

The workshop had a nice mix of people. A lot of the attendees were involved in risk assessment and management, but there were also industry developers of autonomous systems and academics studying ethical and governance issues related to autonomous systems. I felt a little out of place at times, because I knew I wasn't the person the organisers had invited. But the smaller discussion sessions went a little more smoothly.

In the half-day after the workshop had finished I got to have a look around Trondheim in the snow, which was lovely.
